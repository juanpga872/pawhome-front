Project Title: PawHome
Theme
E-commerce

Why?
PawHome primarily arises as a solution to the lack of web platforms offering features that connect animal protection organizations and shelters, facilitating easier adoption and support for stray animals.

Purpose
This platform aims to bring together different animal protection organizations and shelters, helping them raise funds for the care of animals, facilitating adoptions in a simpler and more dynamic way, and allowing them to start businesses selling pet products.

Target Audience
PawHome is aimed at:

Individuals interested in helping dogs and cats in shelters, either through adoption, sponsorship (donating a fixed monthly amount), or making direct donations to organizations.
Pet owners looking for alternative food options for their pets.
Features
Adoption Listings: View and adopt animals from various shelters.
Sponsorship Options: Support organizations through monthly donations.
Product Marketplace: Browse and purchase pet products.
Event Calendar: Stay updated on events organized by shelters.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Styled Components
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (or your chosen backend technology)
