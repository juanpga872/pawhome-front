# Project Title: PawHome

## Theme
**E-commerce**

## Why?
PawHome primarily arises as a solution to the lack of web platforms offering features that connect animal protection organizations and shelters, facilitating easier adoption and support for stray animals.

## Purpose
This platform aims to bring together different animal protection organizations and shelters, helping them raise funds for the care of animals, facilitating adoptions in a simpler and more dynamic way, and allowing them to start businesses selling pet products.

## Target Audience
PawHome is aimed at:

- Individuals interested in helping dogs and cats in shelters, either through adoption, sponsorship (donating a fixed monthly amount), or making direct donations to organizations.

- Pet owners looking for alternative food options for their pets.

## Features
- **Adoption Listings**: View and adopt animals from various shelters.

- **Sponsorship Options**: Support organizations through monthly donations.

- **Product Marketplace**: Browse and purchase pet products.

- **Event Calendar**: Stay updated on events organized by shelters.

## Technologies Used
